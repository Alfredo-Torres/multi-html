    <h2>About Me</h2><br>
    <p class="boxed">Hello as you know I am Alfredo. I am a junior at Lehman College excited to learn
    but at the sametime scared. Why? well, my courses are getting more intense in difficulty
    but not all is bad. I like to learn and always welcome a challenge even if the challenge
    makes me want to ripe my hair out. &#128517;
    </p>

    <P class="boxed">I am familiar with python and C++ and like a splash of java. But one of my professors
        told me once I know one language then is it very easy to learn another and so far he 
        has been correct.<br> To me, being an engineer means constantly learning new ways to do things,
        creating useful stuff for the world to use. It is the main reason I chose a computer
        science degree I want to be able to help other scientists create new technologies. For example, 
        many people are afraid of AI, that is going to be the end of us. They call it the technological singularity
        I don't see it that way I see it has an improvement for humanity and to ensure our survival
        against natural disasters and disease and to liberate us from mundane work so we can all focus on 
        out creativity.
    </P>
